texture input
=============

Textures can be specified in 3 ways:

    1) Load the main image file directly.

        You can also have a texture configuration xml file alongside the image file, it has to have the
        same name, except with a .xml extension. Its root section is texture (see below).

    2) Load a texture configuration xml file directly. Its root section is texture (see below).

    3) Specify textures in the COLLADA file. You can have a configuration xml file alongside the
    COLLADA file, This can contain texture sections (see below) with the attribute name matching
    the name in the COLLADA file.

file formats
------------

These file formats are accepted as image input formats: .bmp, .dds, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .psd, .psp, .tga, .tif, .tiff.

texture section
---------------

This details the configuration xml element that specifies a texture. This specifies the images in a texture
and what format to convert them to. It also specifies mip map generation and general texture settings.
Some attributes apply to the main image specfied prior to this if this is in an alongside configuration file.

Note: currently compressed textures are not supported.

texture element has::

    attribute	name			0 or 1		string
        This is the name of the texture.
        "<root filename>." is prepended to the name.
    attribute	min				0 or 1		"none"|"nearest"|"linear"
        Minification filtering of the texture. The default is linear.
    attribute	mag				0 or 1		"none"|"nearest"|"linear"
        Magnification filtering of the texture. The default is linear.
    attribute	mip				0 or 1		"none"|"nearest"|"linear"
        Mip Map filtering of the texture. The default is nearest.
    attribute	s				0 or 1		"CLAMP"|"MIRRORED"|"REPEAT"|"BORDER"|"MIRROR_ONCE"
        Wrap style in the s direction. Default is repeat.
    attribute	t				0 or 1		"CLAMP"|"MIRRORED"|"REPEAT"|"BORDER"|"MIRROR_ONCE"
        Wrap style in the t direction. Default is repeat.
    attribute	numMips			0 or 1		int
        Amount of Mip levels to use, any levels not specified will be auto generated.
        Default is 1 level.
    attribute	type			0 or 1		"2d"|"+x"|"+y"|"+z"|"-x"|"-y"|"-z"
        If we have an along side image, this specifies the type of the image. Default is 2d.
    element		format			0 or more
        If we have an along side image, images with these formats will be created from that image data.
        If we have images specified, that do not have a specifed format, images with these
        formats will be created from those image data's.
    element		image			0 or more
        These are more images to go in the texture.

image element has::

    attribute	filename		0 or 1		path
        This is the absolute or relative to this file path to the image data.
    attribute	type			0 or 1		"2d"|"+x"|"+y"|"+z"|"-x"|"-y"|"-z"
        This specifies the type of the image. Default is 2d.
    attribute	level			0 or 1		int
        This specifies the mip map level this image is on.
    element		format			0 or more
        Images with these formats will be created from this image data. An output image will be created for each input image and format
		combination. This replaces any defaults rather than adding to them.

format element has::

	attribute	depth			0 or 1		"Unknown"|"32_8_24"|"32"|"24_8"|"11_11_10"|"10_10_10_2"|"16"|"5_6_5"|"5_5_5_1"|"4_4_4_4"|"8"
		This is the pattern of bit depth in the image. A single digit implies all channels have that depth,
		multiple digits implies the depths of each channel.
	attribute	type			0 or 1		"Typeless"|"Float"|"Unsigned"|"Signed"|"Float_Half_Unsigned"|"Float_Half_Signed"
		This the type that all the channels are stored in.
	attribute	layout			0 or 1		"R"|"RG"|"RGB"|"A"|"RGBA"|"L"|"LA"|"BGR"|"BGRA"|"BGRX"|"D"|"DS"
		This is the assignment of each channel.
		R is red, G is green, B is blue, A is alpha, L is luminance (gray), X is unused, D is depth, S is stencil
	attribute	compression		0 or 1		"BC1"|"BC2"|"BC3"|"BC4"|"BC5"|"BC6H"|"BC7"|
											"RGB_S3TC_DXT1"|"RGBA_S3TC_DXT1"|"RGBA_S3TC_DXT3"|"RGBA_S3TC_DXT5"|
											"ETC1_RGB8"|"RGB_PVRTC_4BPPV1"|"RGB_PVRTC_2BPPV1"|"RGBA_PVRTC_4BPPV1"|"RGBA_PVRTC_2BPPV1"|
											"ATC_RGB"|"ATC_RGBA_EXPLICIT_ALPHA"|"ATC_RGBA_INTERPOLATED_ALPHA"
		This is the format of compressed textures.
	attribute	flag			0 or 1		"None"|"Norm"|"Norm_SRGB"|"Alpha"
		This is extra information about the format.
	element		format_alpha	0 or 1
		This is an alternative format that will be used if the image has an alpha channel. (usually used when specifying defaults).

texture settings section
------------------------

In the project.xml or a level file you can specify global or level wide settings for textures.

texture (settings) element has::

    element		format			0 or more
        Images will be created with these formats by default. An output image will be created for each input image and format
		combination. This replaces any defaults rather than adding to them.

Notes
-----

If compression is specified, depth is set to Compressed and depth and layout should not be specified.
If depth or layout is specified, compression should not be specified. Compression and layout are stored in the same attribute.

Note:
Not all formats are viable, in fact many are not. These are the currently available formats for GLES 2:

	type is one of		Signed, Unsigned

	layout is one of	A, RGB, RGBA, L, LA

	depth is one of		8, 5_6_5, 5_5_5_1, 4_4_4_4
