level file
==========

This file is used to specify the scene and game object hierarchy. It pulls in references to
specific nodes but controls the overall orgasnisation of the level data. The root element
is a level element.

level section
-------------

level element has::

	element			model			0 or 1
		Model settings element, see `model input <imodel.html>`_ for details.
	element			texture			0 or 1
		Texture settings element, see `texture input <itexture.html>`_ for details.
	element			node			0 or 1
		Node settings element, see `node input <inode.html>`_ for details.
	element			include			0 or more
		Include the data from a separate file, all file types are used.
	element			gameobject		0 or more
		Start of a hierarchy of game objects.

include element has::

    attribute		filename		1			string
		Absolute or relative (to the level file) path to a file to load.

gameobject element has::

    attribute		name			1			string
		Name of the game object.
    attribute		parent			0 or 1		string
		If we have this it changes the parent to point to another game object, otherwise it is the containing game object.
	attribute		inherit			0 or 1		string
		Pull in features of this node if they are not explicitly specified, see below for details.
	element			gameobject		0 or more
		Child elements of this game object.
	element			<module>		0 or more
		Looks in the list of modules factories for <module> and uses the factory to create a module and calls the module
		to process this element.

Note: what inherit does

Inherit pulls information from the node and converts that into two things. Firstly a frame module, it uses the most
appropiate of frameIdent, framePRS or frameM. Secondly one of dummy, camera or model module, depending on what sort of
data is attached. If you specify a frame sort of module (ie one that sets gotFrame) it does not make a frame module from
the node. If you specify a data sort of module (ie one that sets gotData) it does not make a dummy, camera or model module
from the node.
Inherit also creates child game object derived from child nodes and pulls the same information from them.
