material input
==============

Materials are specified in COLLADA files. The name of the effect that this material will be attached to
is encoded into the name in this format: <material>_<effect> (for example: redCoat_colTex which uses the
colTex effect). If no effect is found matching, the default effect is used.

On profile profile_COMMON, the following types are allowed: constant, lambert, phong, blinn.
Within these the following texture or colour parameters are read: emission, ambient, diffuse, specular, reflective, transparent;
and the following float parameters are read: shininess, reflectivity, transparency, index_of_refraction.
On profile_CG or profile_GLSL any parameters are allowed.

Not all the parameters found on a material are used. only those matching a hint on an effects parameter description
are added.
