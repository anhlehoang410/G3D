model input
===========

A model is specified in a COLLADA file. You can modify the processing of the model by specifying models settings
in the alongside configuration xml file, or more globally in the level xml file or in the project.xml file.

model settings section
----------------------

In the alongside configuration xml you can specify local settings for the model or
in the project.xml or a level file you can specify global or level wide settings for models.

model (settings) element has::

    attribute		name			1			string
        When in an alongside configuration xml this specifies the model to configure.
	attribute		optimise		0 or 1		bool
		Do we apply any optimisation to the model?
	element			tolerance		0 or more
		Tolerance values for each channel, that is how close to merge items of that channel, channels are semantic names (eg TEXCOORD2).
	element			channel			0 or more
		configuration of an individual channel, this restricts the channels available.

tolerance element has::

    attribute		name			1			string
		Name of the channel to set the tolerance on.
    attribute		value			1			float
		Value of the tolerance, 0 means do not optimise this channel.

channel element has::

    attribute		name			1			string
		Name of the channel is to be changed to.
    attribute		semantic		0 or 1		string
		Semantic of the channel to change (eg TEXCOORD). If this is not set the name becomes the semantic and set.
    attribute		set				0 or 1		int
		Number of the semantic set to change (eg 2 (for TEXCOORD2)).
    attribute		default			0 or 1		int
		If set this is the default value to put in the index data.
