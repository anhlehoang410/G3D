G3D
===

G3D is a modular graphics engine built on top of Marmalade and OpenGL ES 2.0.
It is aimed at a similar level to XNA, or can be seen as an alternative to IwGx
utilising OpenGL ES 2.0 rather than OpenGL ES 1.x style of data.

Tutorials
=========

1) `Preparing Data <tutorial1.html>`_
2) `Your first G3D Application <tutorial2.html>`_
3) `Adding a custom module <tutorial3.html>`_

Structure
=========

G3D is made up of 4 parts:

1) `Tier 0 <tier0.html>`_

	Tier 0 contains the core classes, a C++ wrapper around GLES2 that handles
	resource managment, a wrapper around essential Marmalade functions and
	a maths library.

2) `Tier 1 <tier1.html>`_

	This is a set of helper classes for managing the Application loop,
	for loading from text files and loading from a binary wad file.

3) `Tier 2 <tier2.html>`_

	This is a hierarchy of game objects and a scene management system.

4) `Converter <converter.html>`_

	This converts from textures, COLLADA files and configuration xml files
	into text and binary formats used by G3D.

Note: A binary wad file is a collection of binary data packed into a single file.
