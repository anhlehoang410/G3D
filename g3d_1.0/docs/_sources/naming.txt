Shader naming Conventions
=========================

There are certain naming conventions used by G3D, in particular with regard to shaders.

1) attributes

	In order to match shader attributes with channels defined in COLLADA we need to name
	our attributes by semantic names. COLLADA has a long list, as has the HLSL docs.
	Here are a few common ones: VERTEX, NORMAL, COLOR and TEXCOORD. They are optionally 
	followed by a number to distinguish between channels of the same type.

2) uniforms

	Tier 1 and Tier 2 of G3D expect 3 uniforms to have particular names. These uniforms
	are World, View and Proj. These represent the world, view and projection matrices.
	In particular CG3DPositioner and CG3DCamera rely on all effects having these. You can
	use CG3DPositioner and CG3DCamera to change the names globally.

Material naming Conventions
===========================

Material names are made up of two parts, firstly the name of the material followed by the
name of the effect to attach to this material. They are separated by an _. For example::

	red_wall
