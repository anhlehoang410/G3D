effect text file format
=======================

This file has a number of effects, their shaders and their parameters. Shaders can be inline or in an
external file.

	effect <name>

		Specifies the start of a new effect.

	program <format> <filename>|inline [<inline length>]
		
		This either references a file or is followed by a set of binary data (see below for details).
		Format is the GLES identifer of the type of program binary.

	glsl vertex|pixel <filename>|inline [<inline length>]

		This either references a file or is followed by a set of text lines (see below for details).

	hlsl <hlsl target> <entry function> <filename>|inline [<inline length>]

		This either references a file or is followed by a set of text lines (see below for details).
		hlsl target is the type and shader model (eg vs4_0), entry function is the name of the entry point.

	binary vertex|pixel <glsl format>|0 <filename>|inline [<inline length>]
	
		This either references a file or is followed by a set of binary data (see below for details).
		If it is a hlsl shader the format is 0 otherwise it is a GLES identifer of the type of shader binary.

	dynamic|static <name> <type> [<aux name>]

		Add a parameter called name to the effect. In hlsl texture parameters are paired with sampler parameters
		specified by the aux name. "static" is usually applied to parameters that have a value in the material
		and "dynamic" usually applies to parameters that are set by code, but this is just a convention.
		Type is one of: float1|float2|float3|float4|int1|int2|int3|int4|matrix2x2|matrix3x3|matrix4x4|tmatrix2x2|tmatrix3x3|tmatrix4x4|texture
		where float is 1-4 32 bit floating point values, int is 1-4 32 bit integer values, matrix is a 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4 matrix of 32 bit floating point values,
		tmatrix is transposed on setting it and texture is a CG3DTexture.
		
Inline text files

	Inline length specifies the number of lines that are used by the shader. The next "inline length" lines are the shader.

Inline binary files

	Inline length specifies the size of the binary data. The format of the data is::
		
		i [[' ']<byte>]*

	That is each line starts with i and is followed by a number of bytes specified in hex, optionally separated by spaces.
