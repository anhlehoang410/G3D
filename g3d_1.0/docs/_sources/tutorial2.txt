Tutorial 2: Your first G3D Application
======================================

This tutorial will take you through creating your first G3D application.
We will make use of the data we created in tutorial 1 (or you can use
data from one of the examples).

1) Making the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the root directory that we created in tutorial 1 (that is the directory
containing the data and data-source directories), if you did not follow
tutorial 1, make a blank directory. In this directory create 2 blank files,
tutorial.mkb and tutorial.cpp

In tutorial.mkb add these lines::

	file tutorial.cpp
	subproject ../../src/g3d

This creates a Marmalade project, which contains one file, tutorial.cpp and
pulls in the g3d subproject. You will probably need to adjust the subproject
path to reflect your file hierarchy.

Now run this mkb.

2) First G3D Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now in tutorial.cpp we include some headers::

	#include "G3DCore.h"
	#include "G3DMarmalade.h"
	#include "G3DHelper.h"

These load the headers for some of the different sections of G3D. We are loading G3DCore,
which is the interfaces to the graphics and system sections; G3DMarmalade,
which is an implementation of the system section; and G3DHelper, which is a set of
helper classes, including encapsulating the main loop. These headers and headers for
other G3D sections are in h directory of the g3d source.

Next we create our application class::

	class CGame : public CG3DApp
	{
	public:
		CGame() : CG3DApp(MakeG3DSystemMarmalade()) {}
	protected:
		virtual void InitInternal() { }
		virtual bool UpdateInternal(float timeStep) { return true; }
		virtual void RenderInternal(float timeStep) { }
		virtual void ShutdownInternal() { }
	};

This derives our application class from the G3DHelper class CG3DApp.
Firstly we initialise CG3DApp with an implementation of the system
section, this is an interface between Marmalade and G3D. Next we
implement four functions. InitInternal gets called first, then on
each frame, UpdateInternal and RenderInternal get called, then
ShutdownInternal gets called when the app gets shut down, this
happens due to external events, or if UpdateInternal returns false.

Next we need a main function::

	int main()
	{
		CGame game;
		game.Run();
	}

This creates a standard main function, which creates our application
class and run's it.

Now we need to set up some global state, in the InitInternal function add::

	m_Graphics->SetGlobalSet(CG3DGlobalSet::COLOUR, new CG3DColourSet(CG3DColour(0, 255, 0)));
	m_Graphics->SetGlobalSet(CG3DGlobalSet::DEPTH, new CG3DDepthSet(1));
	m_Graphics->SetGlobalSet(CG3DGlobalSet::CULL, new CG3DCullSet(CG3DCullSet::CULL_BACK));

Each of these GlobalSets, sets a few global state variables. The main variable is passed
to the constructor, the others set on the class.
ColourSet deals with clearing the colour buffer and masking colour output.
DepthSet deals with writing to the depth buffer and masking depth output.
CullSet deals with culling front and or back faces of polygons.
GlobalSet.h in the core/h directory of the g3d source, gives more details
of these sets and the others.

We can now run this, our very first g3d application, but all we will see is a green screen.

3) Adding data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have followed along with the first tutorial you should have a g3d
file in the data directory. If not copy tut.g3d from samples/tutorial/data.

We need to add these headers::

	#include "G3DBinary.h"
	#include "G3DHierarchy.h"

These load the headers for the binary reader section and the hierarchy section.

Now add this code into your InitInternal function::

	CG3DPtr<CG3DBinaryLoader> binary = new CG3DBinaryLoader(m_Graphics.get());
	binary->InitFile("test.g3d");

This creates a binary loader and loads your g3d file's data table,
change the name if it is different. CG3DPtr is a smart pointer that
automatically calls AddRef and Release on the item it contains,
if you need a C pointer call get() on it.

Now we need to load some data from the file. first add these fields
on the class::

	private:
		CG3DPtr<CG3DGameObject> m_Hier;
		CG3DPtr<CG3DScene> m_Scene;

These point to the game object hierarchy and the scene to draw.

We need to load these from the file, add this into the InitInternal
function::

	m_Scene = binary->GetData<CG3DScene>("test.testScene");
	m_Hier = binary->GetData<CG3DGameObject>("test.root");

This loads the scene and the game object hierarchy, you will
probably have to adjust your names, look for your scene
and the top level gameobject in your level file and prefix
with the name given to the file. If you did not specify a scene
it will be called scene. If you copied tut.g3d, the names are
test.testScene and test.root.

Add this to your InitInternal function::

	m_Scene->Upload();

This uploads all the graphics data in the scene (The model module
adds its models to the scene on activation) to the graphics device.

Add this to your UpdateInternal function::

	m_Hier->DoFrame(timeStep);

This dispatches any pending events on the game objects and sends
the update event to each game object. timeStep is the amount of
time elapsed since DoFrame was last called.

And finally this to your RenderInternal function::

	m_Scene->Apply();

This draws all the objects in the scene.

That is it, run your app you should now be drawing a model on screen.

If this does not look very good try adding a framePRS to the test
game object in your level file to adjust the models position, or adjust the
cameras position and perspective matrix.
