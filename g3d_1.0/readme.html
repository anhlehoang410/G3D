  <h2>Welcome to G3D</h2>
  <p>
G3D is a modular graphics engine built on top of Marmalade and OpenGL ES 2.0.
It is aimed at a similar level to XNA, or can be seen as a replacement for IwGx
utilising OpenGL ES 2.0 rather than OpenGL ES 1.x style of data.</p>

<p>The documentation is here: <a href="docs/index.html">docs/index.html</a>.</p>

This is the folder structure:
