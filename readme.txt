Welcome to G3D

G3D is a modular graphics engine built on top of Marmalade and OpenGL ES 2.0.
It is aimed at a similar level to XNA, or can be seen as a replacement for IwGx
utilising OpenGL ES 2.0 rather than OpenGL ES 1.x style of data.

Implemented

    3D rendering.
    Text and binary loading.
    Converting to text and binary from COLLADA and XML files.
    Render to texture.
    Scene hierarchy.

TODO

    2D and font rendering.
    Compressed textures.
    Animation and skins.
    DX11 back-end.

Please report any bugs through github.
I do this project in my spare time, Please be aware, this is just a hobby
for me, so I might be slow in replying.
